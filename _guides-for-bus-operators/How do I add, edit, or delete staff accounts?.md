First, on the top navigation menu, select `Accounts`, then `Staff`.

Adding a staff account
----------------------

1.  Click on the `Add Staff Account` button beside the search bar.
2.  Fill in the fields accordingly.
    *   The default role is `Driver/Attendant`. This gives the staff access to the [Driver's App](https://go.gov.sg/osb-driver) for the routes listed under the `Route name` column.
    *   `Coordinator` role gives access to the [Operator's App](https://go.gov.sg/osb) and all the information inside.
        *   ‚ùó Only set `Coordinator` role for the administrators of your company.

Click on "Add Staff Account"

Editing an existing staff account
---------------------------------

1.  In the table displaying the staff list, click on `Edit` of the row in which you wish to make changes.
    1.  `Status`: Set `Inactive` for staff whose access you wish to remove, but whom you don't want to delete. Their information will remain in this table but they will lose access to OneSchoolBus.
    2.  `Route name`, `Bus No.`, and `School` can only be changed on the `Edit Bus Route` page.
