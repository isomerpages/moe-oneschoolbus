- üí° `Status`, `Name`, and `Role` columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order.
- üí° Fields that are not shaded are editable. remember to click **save changes** when you are done with the edits.
- üí° To find a specific staff member, type part or all of their name into the search bar. The list of staff gets filtered as you type.
    
#### What do the different columns mean?

1. `Status`: Active staff will have access to the app; inactive staff will not.
2. `Route name`: A list of routes that the staff is linked to. This gives them access to the routes on the [Driver's App](https://go.gov.sg/osb-driver).
3. `Bus No.`: The bus numbers of the staff's linked routes.
4. `School`: The schools that the staff's linked routes belong to.
5. `Role`: Staff Role.
    - The default role is `Driver/Attendant`. This gives the staff access to the [Driver's App](https://go.gov.sg/osb-driver) for the routes listed under the `Route name` column.
    - `Coordinator` role gives access to the [Operator's App](https://go.gov.sg/osb) and all the information inside.
