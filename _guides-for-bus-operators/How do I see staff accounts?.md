1.  On the top navigation menu, select `Accounts`. A sub menu will appear underneath. Select `Staff`.

    Staff page
    
    <aside> ðŸ’¡ `Status`, `Name`, and `Role` columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order.
    
    </aside>
    
    <aside> ðŸ’¡ To find a specific staff member, type part or all of their name into the search bar. The list of staff gets filtered as you type.
    
    </aside>
    

What do the different columns mean?
-----------------------------------

*   `Status`: Active staff will have access to the app; inactive staff will not.
*   `Route name`: A list of routes that the staff is linked to. This gives them access to the routes on the [Driver's App](https://go.gov.sg/osb-driver).
*   `Bus No.`: The bus numbers of the staff's linked routes.
*   `School`: The schools that the staff's linked routes belong to.
*   `Role`: Staff Role.
    *   The default role is `Driver/Attendant`. This gives the staff access to the [Driver's App](https://go.gov.sg/osb-driver) for the routes listed under the `Route name` column.
    *   `Coordinator` role gives access to the [Operator's App](https://go.gov.sg/osb) and all the information inside.
