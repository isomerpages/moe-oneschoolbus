Clicking on the Students link from the Data Exercise page leads you to this page.
1. Ensure the **Error/Incomplete Fields** filter is on.
2. Fields that are incomplete or have errors are either shaded Red or Orange. Tap on them to make edits.
3. Click on **Save Changes** to complete the modifications.

**Note:**
- If the page is empty with the Error/Incomplete Fields filter on, your students have all the required information.
- Bus Fare is the original bus fare without subsidy from the Financial Assistance Scheme.
- In the scenario that the student’s name cannot be found in the MOE database, you can add the last 4 digits of the student’s NRIC/FIN to broaden the search. Alternatively, check that the student’s name is properly spelled and try saving again.

### Declaring That You Are Unable to Obtain a Match Student by Name or NRIC

**[Important]** If you have keyed in the last 4 digits of the student’s NRIC/FIN and checked that the student’s name is correct, but the system is still not able to find the student, you will have to declare that the data is accurate to proceed.
