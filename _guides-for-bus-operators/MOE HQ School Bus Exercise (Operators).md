*   Clicking on the `**Students**` link from the `**Tasks**` page leads you to this page. The `**Show Errors**` switch should be on.
    *   If the page is empty, congratulations! Your students have all the required information.
    *   Bus Fare is one of the requirements that needs to be submitted. This bus fare is the original bus fare without subsidy from the Financial Assistance Scheme.
    *   In the scenario that the studentâ€™s name cannot be found in the MOE database, you can add the last 4 digits of the studentâ€™s NRIC/FIN to broaden the search. Alternatively, you could check that the studentâ€™s name is properly spelled and try saving again.

<aside> ðŸ’¡ **\[IMPORTANT\]** If you have keyed in the last 4 digits of the studentâ€™s NRIC/FIN and checked that the studentâ€™s name is correct, but the system is still not able to find the student, you will have to declare that the data is accurate to proceed.
