## Creating New Bus Routes

1. Click on the **Create Route** button on the left sidebar and fill in the fields on the form:

   - **School**: What school does this route serve? If your school is not on the dropdown, please contact the school’s Admin Manager to add you to the system.
   - **Pick Up/Drop Off**: The route is Pick Up if students are going to school, and Drop Off if the students are returning home.
   - **Bus Route**: The name of the bus route for your reference. (Example: AM1, AM2, PM1, PM2)
   - **Bus No.**: The bus no. will be reflected on the drivers’ attendance app. (Example: Bus 1, Bus 2)
   - **Vehicle Plate No.**: The license plate number of your buses.
   - **Vehicle Capacity**: The maximum number of students that can fit in your bus.
   - **Start Time/Dismissal Time**: If this is a pick-up route, start time refers to the time at the first stop. If this is a drop-off route, start time is when your bus leaves school.
   - **Driver/Attendant Mobile Number**: We use this mobile number for your staff to log into the attendance app, so make sure this is correct. For foreign numbers, add the country code in front, e.g. +60.

2. Press **Save** after you fill in the form. You will now see your created bus route.

3. Press **Save Changes** button above the table.

**Note:**
