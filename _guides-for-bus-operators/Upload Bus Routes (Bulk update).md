## Using the Excel template

**School Bus Template Instructions**: The first sheet is instructions on how to use the template. Please read it carefully before filling in your data in the subsequent sheets. 

**Start Inputting Data**: You may tap on the tabs below to start inputting bus route data into the template.

**Description**: Provides information on the required data to be input into this excel template. Red fields are compulsory, while orange fields are required only for the submission exercise sometime in February annually.

**Filling in the Information**: The fields are to be filled in across in the direction displayed in the screenshot above. 

Note: You can upload more than 3 buses with the excel template. Although the downloaded blank school bus template only shows 3 buses, you may upload as many buses as you would like. Just duplicate existing lists to add more.

Fill in bus route details on 1 row: Do note that you do not need to drag route details for all student rows. You will only need to complete the first row and leave the rest of the cells blank.

**Student Details**: Each row starting from the student name column represents a student, and all columns should be filled up to minimize any missing data and upload issues later.

Remember to save your file after you have completed the template!

Note: If you are having difficulties with student class, remember that this is an optional field! Feel free to leave it blank. Our system may be able to autofill the value for you if it can find the student in our system.
