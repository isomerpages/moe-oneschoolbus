### Bulk Update Tips for Faster Data Entry 

You will learn how to input data for excel faster and more efficiently with bulk update.

Below are the commonly met issues that operators face when uploading data via bulk update.

#### 1: You can upload more than 3 buses with excel spreadsheet.

- Although the downloaded blank school bus template only shows 3 buses , you can upload as many buses as you would like. Just duplicate existing lists to add more.

- Try to label the bus routes in the manner that it is easy for you to keep track

#### 2: You can duplicate lists for buses (IN) and (OUT)

- Right click on the morning bus and click move or copy as shown below

![](/images/Operator/bus%20ops%20move%20or%20copy.png)

- Right click on the morning bus and click move or copy as shown below. Then rename the bus

![](/images/Operator/bus%20ops%20rename%20after%20duplicating.png)

- Change the duplicated sheet details
   - Route name Bus 1 IN â€”> Bus 1 Out
   - Pick up â€”> Drop off
   - Subsequently add or remove students from the list depending on who is taking the afternoon bus.

#### 3: You only need to fill in bus route details on 1 row.

- Look at a sample of a completed excel list below.

- Do note that you do not need to drag route details for all student rows. just complete the first row will do. leave the rest of the cells blank.

![](/images/Operator/bus%20ops%20do%20not%20need%20to%20drag%20down.png)

ðŸ’¡ If you are having difficulties with student class, remember that this is an optional field! Feel free to leave it blank. Our system may be able to autofill the value for you if it can find the student in our system!

#### 4: Try to fill up all fields (i.e. school fees and postal code)

- Try to fill up all fields e.g. school fees and postal code even though its optional (no asterix)
- This is because these fields are required for submission to HQ. It might be easier to add them in as a bulk update now than adding them later on manually for data submission.
