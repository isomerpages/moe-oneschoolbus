# How do I bulk add or update data using excel?
----------

### Bulk Update
On this page, you will learn how to upload or update a lot of data at one go in OneSchoolBus. This data comprises of your route, driver, and student information. 

First, click on **Routes**, and then **Bulk Update** on the top navigation menu.

##### Step 1: Select Preferences
1.  You will see the page `Preferences`. Select the options under each step.

    Step 1: Select Preferences
    
    1.  `A. Select the year to add/update data`: This refers to the year for which your routes belong to. For instance, if you are adding the route "Bus 1 AM" for the year 2022, select 2022.
    2.  `B. Select a template`: This refers to the template you will be able to download in the next step.
        1.  `Blank Excel template` will give you an Excel file with an `Instructions` sheet and empty sheets with a header row.
        2.  (Only if you have data inside) `Excel template with data from selected year` will give you an Excel file that is pre-filled with existing data from that year. You can use this file to make bulk changes to your data in OneSchoolBus.
    3.  `B. Select preferred method to add/update data`: This option is only available as step B if you have data for this year, and are adding data for next year.
        1.  Selecting `Automatically copy this year's data to next year` allows you to let OneSchoolBus duplicate this year's information to next year without needing Excel. If you choose this option, you will move directly to `Step 3: View summary` when you press `Proceed`.
2.  Press `Proceed`.
