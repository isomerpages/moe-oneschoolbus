# Managing Students on OSB

Learn how to view, add, edit, or delete student records. You can also change a student’s name; details are in “How do I add, edit, or delete students?”

## Accessing My List of Students

On the top navigation menu, select Students. The menu will expand to show all the schools you are serving in MOE. Click on the school which you want to view.

The Name, Gender, Class, and Bus Fare columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order. Students are divided into year tabs to store data for multiple years. To find a specific student, type part or all of their name into the search bar. The list of students gets filtered as you type.

## Add New Student Details

1. Click on Add Student beside the search bar.
2. An Add student pop-up will appear. Fill in the fields accordingly.
3. Click on Save to save your changes.


---
## Edit Existing Student Details

1. Tap on any of the fields.
2. The field will expand, and you will be able to type in the changes and edit.
3. Click on Save Changes to save your changes; otherwise, no changes will be saved.

**Note:** NRIC / FIN (last 4 characters) is not a required field. The purpose is for internal identification when there are students with identical names, and OSB is unable to match the student name accurately in the MOE system.

## Delete Existing Students

1. In the student table, find the students you want to delete.
2. Next to the student name, under #, select the checkbox to select the student.
3. The total number of students selected will be shown at the bottom left of the screen.
4. Click the Remove rows button at the bottom right-hand corner of the page. A pop-up will appear to confirm. Click on the Remove rows button again to confirm, or Cancel.

**Note:** If you remove a student from this list, the student will be automatically removed from all bus routes as well.
