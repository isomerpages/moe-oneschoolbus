### Logging in

1. **Enter your phone number**. For foreign mobile numbers, add the country code in front, e.g., `+60`.
2. **Press Login**.
3. If it says "Invalid phone number," inquire with your School AM to check if your phone number is among the bus coordinators serving your school. Bus coordinators in your company will be able to give you access.

   You should receive an SMS with your six-digit One-Time Pin (OTP) within the next few minutes. **Enter the OTP**.

4. **Press Next**.
5. If you don't receive an SMS after 3 minutes, **press the Back arrow button (&lt;)** on your browser and try again.

You're in! The first page you see is the Bus Routes page. If there are no bus routes, you will see a diagram to guide you on how to get started.
