    **School:** What school does this route serve? If your school is not on the dropdown, please contact the schoolâ€™s Admin Manager to add you to the system.
    
    **Pick Up/Drop Off:** The route is `Pick Up` if students are going to school, and `Drop Off` if the students are returning home.
    
    **Bus Route:** The name of the bus route for your reference. (Example: AM1, AM2, PM1, PM2)
    
    **Bus No.:** The bus no. will be reflected on the driversâ€™ attendance app. (Example: Bus 1, Bus 2)
    
    **Vehicle Plate No.:** The license plate number of your buses.
    
    **Vehicle Capacity:** The maximum number of students that can fit in your bus.
    
    **Start Time/Dismissal Time:** If this is a pick-up route, start time refers to the time at the first stop. If this is a drop-off route, start time is when your bus leaves school.
    
    **Driver/Attendant Mobile Number**: We use this mobile number for your staff to log into the attendance app, so make sure this is correct. For foreign numbers, add the country code in front, eg `+60`. Any changes to the name and contact number here
