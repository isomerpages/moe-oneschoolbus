## Step 2: Mark Student Attendance

1. **Marking Attendance**
   - Opt for **Mark all** to mark all students as present. Individually mark a student as "Present" (✔️) or "Absent" (❌ ) by tapping the white box next to their names.
   - To call a student's parent/guardian, tap on the phone number 📞 next to their name, which will open your phone app with the number.
