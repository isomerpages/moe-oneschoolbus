Welcome to our companion application for OneSchoolBus! Head on to [https://go.gov.sg/osb-driver](https://go.gov.sg/osb-driver) on your smartphone to begin using the attendance application.

A Chinese version of the application is available at [https://go.gov.sg/osb-driver-cn](https://go.gov.sg/osb-driver-cn).
