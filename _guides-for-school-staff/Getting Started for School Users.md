<h1>Getting Started for School Users</h1>
<p>Welcome to our school application for OneSchoolBus! Here you will find
guides on how to use OSB as a school user. It provides step-by-step instructions
for users to effectively navigate and utilize the OSB system, covering
topics from initial access requests to specific operational tasks.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://go.gov.sg/osb-school" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OSB School Application</a> on
your desktop to begin using the application.</p>
