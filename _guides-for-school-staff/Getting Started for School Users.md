Getting Started for School Users
================================

Welcome to our school application for OneSchoolBus! Here you will find guides on how to use OSB as a school user. It provides step-by-step instructions for users to effectively navigate and utilise the OSB system, covering topics from initial access requests to specific operational tasks. 

Head on to [https://go.gov.sg/osb-school](https://go.gov.sg/osb-school) on your desktop to begin using the application.
