<p>Most of the data will be greyed out as these data are input by school
bus operators.</p>
<p>Click on the FAS status to select either None, MOE FAS, School FAS, or
Both. This is required for the Data Submission Exercise in Q1 annually.</p>
<p>Should you see an exclamation mark beside the NRIC box, this happens because
the names of the students are unable to be matched with the School Cockpit.
You may click proceed to help bus operators identify and select the correct
student. Refer to the MOE HQ School bus data submission exercise on the
left for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will only see students with a bus route allocated
to the student. When compared with the bus operator student information,
the number of students may be different due to this reason.</p>
