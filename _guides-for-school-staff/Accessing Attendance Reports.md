1. Click on "Attendance" to access the attendance report page.

2. Select the date range of the attendance report you would like to acquire.

3. Click on the "Download Report" button; it will download an excel report showing the attendance of the students within all the bus routes.

**Note:** If there are attendance records shown, it would mean that the bus operator did not use OSB to take attendance via the driver portal.
