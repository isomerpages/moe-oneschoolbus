### Verifying Students Who Cannot Be Found in School Cockpit


Sometimes, you may come across students whose identities need verification on the student page. This happens when the system cannot automatically match a student's name with a record in School Cockpit. It can occur for various reasons, such as having two students with the exact same name.

1.  Click on the students page on the top navigation bar
    
2.  Hover your mouse over the blue ! button 
    
3.  Proceed to search for the student in the School Cockpit.
    
4.  In the pop up that appears, you can search for the student and select the student by clicking on the radio button next to the desired student.
    

  

**Note:** 

*   If you can't find a matching student, it might be because the bus operator entered the name incorrectly. Please check with them to identify the correct student.
    
*   Should any data need changes, you can liaise and message your bus operator directly before clicking Next on the data submission page.
