<h3>Verifying Students Who Cannot Be Found in School Cockpit</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you may come across students whose identities need verification
on the student page. This happens when the system cannot automatically
match a student's name with a record in School Cockpit. It can occur for
various reasons, such as having two students with the exact same name.</p>
