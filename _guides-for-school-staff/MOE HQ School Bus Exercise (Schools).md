How do I complete the MOE HQ School Bus Exercise (Schools)?

##### 1\. How do I check my bus operatorsâ€™ data entry progress for the MOE HQ School Bus exercise?

*   You can click on the **`Students`** or the **`Routes`** to check on the missing information that your operators have yet to enter. If your operators have questions about completing the missing information, you may redirect them to this guide: [How do I complete the MOE HQ School Bus Exercise?

<aside> ðŸ’¡ On the students and routes page, you may see all incomplete fields that your bus operators have yet to fill in. You may refer to this guide: [How do I complete the MOE HQ School Bus Exercise? (Operators)](https://www.notion.so/How-do-I-complete-the-MOE-HQ-School-Bus-Exercise-Operators-a41470fbe74b430fa4d44b744a23956e?pvs=21) to find out about their submission requirements.

##### 2\. How do I verify students who cannot be found in School Cockpit?

*   Sometimes, you may come across students whose identities need to be verified on the student page. This happens when the system cannot automatically match a student's name with a record in School Cockpit. This can occur for various reasons, such as having two students with the exact same name. 

Example of student required for verification is shown below:

*   Hover your mouse over the **blue ! button** and you will be prompted with the option to proceed to search for the student in school cockpit.

*   Click **Proceed** to search for the student in School Cockpit. You'll see a list of students with similar names, and you can choose the correct one. 

	<aside> ðŸ’¡  If you can't find a matching student, it might be because the bus operator entered the name incorrectly. Please check with them to identify the correct student.

	<aside> ðŸ’¡ Should there be any data that needs changes, you may liase and message your bus operator directly before clicking next!

##### 3\. How do I submit data to HQ and conclude the submission exercise?

*   Press **NEXT** once all your operators have submitted their data. Requirements needed to be met before you can press next:
    *   There must be at least **1 bus route and student(s)** included into the route.
    *   **Student, Routes and Company profile** fields are fully completed
    *   Operator must click **NOTIFY SCHOOL** button on their page to indicate done.
    *   All bus operators (for schools with multiple operators) have also clicked **NOTIFY SCHOOL** button.

		ðŸ’¡ Please strongly urge your bus operators to submit the data **ahead of the deadline!**
