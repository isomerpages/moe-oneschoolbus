# Completing the MOE HQ School Bus Exercise (Schools)

The MOE HQ School Bus Exercise is an annual event held by the end of February. During this time, you'll need to submit bus route and student details provided by bus operators to MOE HQ using OSB.

## 1. Checking Bus Operatorsâ€™ Data Entry Progress

- Click on **Data Exercise** to view data entry progress for each of your bus operators. Click "Show more" to see detailed progress or incomplete information.

- You can click on **`Students`** or **`Routes`** to check missing information that your operators haven't entered. If your operators have questions about completing the missing information, you can redirect them to this guide: [How to Complete the MOE HQ School Bus Exercise (Operators)](https://www.notion.so/How-do-I-complete-the-MOE-HQ-School-Bus-Exercise-Operators-a41470fbe74b430fa4d44b744a23956e?pvs=21)

## 2. Verifying Students Who Cannot Be Found in School Cockpit

- Sometimes, you may come across students whose identities need verification on the student page. This happens when the system cannot automatically match a student's name with a record in School Cockpit. It can occur for various reasons, such as having two students with the exact same name. 

   Example of a student requiring verification is shown below:

- Hover your mouse over the **blue ! button** to proceed to search for the student in School Cockpit.

- Click **Proceed** to search for the student in School Cockpit. You'll see a list of students with similar names, and you can choose the correct one. 

ðŸ’¡ If you can't find a matching student, it might be because the bus operator entered the name incorrectly. Please check with them to identify the correct student.

ðŸ’¡ Should any data need changes, you can liaise and message your bus operator directly before clicking "Next."

## 3. Submitting Data to HQ and Concluding the Submission Exercise

    - **Student, Routes, and Company profile** fields must be fully completed.
    - Operator must click **NOTIFY SCHOOL** button on their page to indicate done.
